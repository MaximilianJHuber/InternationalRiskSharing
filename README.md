# InternationalRiskSharing
This is a replication of key aspects of [Financial Intermediation, International Risk Sharing, and Reserve Currencies](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20130479) by Maggiori published in the American Economic Review in 2017.

The project is very much work in progress, hopefully.
